 This is the Project about Collector Bot to automate the farming industry</br>
 Technologies Utilised</br>
 Python 2.7</br>
 Open CV</br>
 Embedded C</br>
 V-REP(Virtual Robotics Experimentation Platform)</br>
 The main objective of the collector bot is to segregate the fruits and to handover the good fruits to the truck which mo.ves in a defined path and stops at one of the every 6 perch-points for 10 secs.<br />
As this is a prototype we have used aruco markers as a parameter to differentiate between good fruits and the rotten ones.<br />
We tried to implement less sensors wherever possible and the entire prototype uses only an overhead camera for its decision making and navigation process.<br />
The overhead camera provides a wide view of what is happening to the control station(Laptop) and it issues commands to the collector bot to navigate it in the right direction automatically without any human intervention.
